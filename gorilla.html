          <p>When Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzee David Greybeard fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly became blurry. Tool use was no longer uniquely human, leading Dr. Louis Leakey, Jane‚Äôs mentor, to famously say, ‚ÄúNow we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.‚Äù

We know that chimpanzees are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom, sharing 98.6% of our DNA. Chimpanzees are also known to exhibit remarkably human-like behaviors, such as grieving over the loss of a loved one, generating strategies to thrive in social groups, and even learning sign language.

But what allows us to share these things in common? Is it our brain structure, our shared genetic similarities, or our cultures? Turns out, it‚Äôs a mix of many things!

To start, it‚Äôs important to understand the chimpanzee ‚Äúfission-fusion‚Äù social system. In this system, there are communities of up to 100 individuals that occasionally come together to eat, socialize, and mate, but spend most of their time in tighter sub-groups. Early human communities are thought to have lived in similar groups</p>
